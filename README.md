# LLM Multiple Generation Notebook

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various generation tasks with Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides examples for summarization, text generation, few-shot learning, and translation, utilizing different LLM APIs to showcase the capabilities of multiple providers.

## Repository Structure

- **[summarize_llm_function.ipynb](https://github.com/simonpierreboucher/llm_multiple_generation/blob/main/summarize_llm_function.ipynb)**: Demonstrates text summarization using LLMs, with examples for generating concise summaries from longer texts.
- **[generate_llm_function.ipynb](https://github.com/simonpierreboucher/llm_multiple_generation/blob/main/generate_llm_function.ipynb)**: Provides examples of text generation, covering creative and informative text outputs.
- **[fewshot_llm_function.ipynb](https://github.com/simonpierreboucher/llm_multiple_generation/blob/main/fewshot_llm_function.ipynb)**: Explores few-shot learning techniques, where the model is given a limited number of examples to guide its responses in specific tasks.
- **[translate_llm_function.ipynb](https://github.com/simonpierreboucher/llm_multiple_generation/blob/main/translate_llm_function.ipynb)**: Illustrates language translation capabilities using LLMs, allowing for translations across multiple language pairs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run these notebooks, you will need:
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- API keys for any relevant LLM services (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere, Anthropic)
- Required dependencies as listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/simonpierreboucher/llm_multiple_generation.git
   cd llm_multiple_generation
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Notebooks

1. **Start Jupyter Notebook**: Open Jupyter by navigating to the repository folder and running:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. **Select a Notebook**: Open any of the notebooks (summarize, generate, few-shot, or translate) to explore the functionality.
3. **Follow Instructions**: Each notebook includes instructions and code for working with LLMs in the context of specific generation tasks.

## Use Cases

- **Summarization**: Generate concise summaries for documents, articles, or other text inputs.
- **Text Generation**: Create new content, stories, or information-rich text with minimal input.
- **Few-Shot Learning**: Provide a few examples to guide the model's responses for targeted tasks, such as answering specific questions or following a template.
- **Translation**: Translate text across multiple languages using LLMs, useful for multilingual applications.
